Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor library - runtime
 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor.
 .
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: SELinux runtime shared libraries
 This package provides the shared libraries for Security-enhanced
 Linux that provides interfaces (e.g. library functions for the
 SELinux kernel APIs like getcon(), other support functions like
 getseuserbyname()) to SELinux-aware applications. Security-enhanced
 Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities with
 enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access
 controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
 architectural components originally developed to improve the security
 of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide
 general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
 control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type
 Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set
 process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy
 decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux
 API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary
 policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older
 version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.

Description: system and service manager
 systemd is a replacement for sysvinit.  It is dependency-based and
 able to read the LSB init script headers in addition to parsing rcN.d
 links as hints.
 .
 It also provides process supervision using cgroups and the ability to
 not only depend on other init script being started, but also
 availability of a given mount point or dbus service.
 .
 Installing the systemd package will not switch your init system unless you
 boot with init=/bin/systemd or install systemd-sysv in addition.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 The insserv program is used by the standard SysV-based init system. It
 updates the order of symlinks in /etc/rc?.d/ based on dependencies
 specified by LSB headers in the init.d scripts themselves.
 .
 These declared relations between scripts make it possible to optimize
 the boot sequence for the currently installed set of packages, while
 detecting and rejecting dependency loops.
 .
 Using insserv incorrectly can result in an unbootable system.

Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

Description: SELinux library for manipulating binary security policies
 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number
 of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
 mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
 kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
 improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type EnforcementÂ®, Role-based Access
 Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.
 It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well
 as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations
 on binary policies such as customizing policy boolean settings.

Pick an image to use for your photo ID.  The image must be a JPEG file.
Remember that the image is stored within your public key.  If you use a
very large picture, your key will become very large as well!
Keeping the image close to 240x288 is a good size to use.

 What keysize do you want for the Authentication key? (%u)  What keysize do you want for the Encryption key? (%u)  What keysize do you want for the Signature key? (%u)  What keysize do you want for the subkey? (%u)  What keysize do you want? (%u)  When you sign a user ID on a key, you should first verify that the key
belongs to the person named in the user ID.  It is useful for others to
know how carefully you verified this.

"0" means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you verified the
    key.

"1" means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to own it
    but you could not, or did not verify the key at all.  This is useful for
    a "persona" verification, where you sign the key of a pseudonymous user.

"2" means you did casual verification of the key.  For example, this could
    mean that you verified the key fingerprint and checked the user ID on the
    key against a photo ID.

"3" means you did extensive verification of the key.  For example, this could
    mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the owner of the key in
    person, and that you checked, by means of a hard to forge document with a
    photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key owner matches the
    name in the user ID on the key, and finally that you verified (by exchange
    of email) that the email address on the key belongs to the key owner.

Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are *only* examples.
In the end, it is up to you to decide just what "casual" and "extensive"
mean to you when you sign other keys.

If you don't know what the right answer is, answer "0". You are about to revoke these signatures:
 You are using the `%s' character set.
 You can't change the expiration date of a v3 key
 You can't delete the last user ID!
 You did not specify a user ID. (you may use "-r")
 You don't want a passphrase - this is probably a *bad* idea!

 You don't want a passphrase - this is probably a *bad* idea!
I will do it anyway.  You can change your passphrase at any time,
using this program with the option "--edit-key".

 You have signed these user IDs on key %s:
 You may not add a designated revoker to a PGP 2.x-style key.
 You may not add a photo ID to a PGP2-style key.
 You may not make an OpenPGP signature on a PGP 2.x key while in --pgp2 mode.
 You may try to re-create the trustdb using the commands:
 You must select at least one key.
 You must select at least one user ID.
 You must select exactly one key.
 You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

 You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for

 You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for user:
"%.*s"
%u-bit %s key, ID %s, created %s%s
 You selected this USER-ID:
    "%s"

 You should specify a reason for the certification.  Depending on the
context you have the ability to choose from this list:
  "Key has been compromised"
      Use this if you have a reason to believe that unauthorized persons
      got access to your secret key.
  "Key is superseded"
      Use this if you have replaced this key with a newer one.
  "Key is no longer used"
      Use this if you have retired this key.
  "User ID is no longer valid"
      Use this to state that the user ID should not longer be used;
      this is normally used to mark an email address invalid.
